# Philosopedia

## Inspiration

_"Wikipedia trivia: if you take any article, click on the first link in the article text not in parentheses or italics, and then repeat, you will eventually end up at 'Philosophy'."_
_[http://xkcd.com/903/](XKCD #903)_

## About

Philosopedia is a simple Python app that attempts to link various entries on Wikipedia to the Wikipedia entry for 'Philosophy', in an attempt to validate the above assertion.

This has been done before (see: [http://ryanelmquist.com/cgi-bin/xkcdwiki](here) and [http://xefer.com/wikipedia](here)), but I wanted to not only open-source the code, but
also keep a running inventory of words that both were and weren't able to link to Philosophy.

 * [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for HTML parsing
